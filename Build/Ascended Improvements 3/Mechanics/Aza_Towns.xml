These skinny, stepped fields are cut into hill and mountain sides, preventing the run off of irrigation water and providing space for arable land, usually where none previously was possible. The Incas in particular were masters of terrace farming, and erected large, drystone walls to hold their terraces in place. After building the terrace's shape, the Incas then constructed systems of canals and aqueducts to provide the terraces with constant water, increasting the land's fertility.

			<Text>A polder is a low-lying tract enclosed by dikes with the water drained. In general, polder is land reclaimed from a lake or seabed, from flood plains, or from marshes. In time, the drained land subsides so that all polder is eventually below the surrounding water level. Because of this, water seeps into the drained area and must be pumped out or otherwise drained. The dikes are usually made of readily available materials, earth or sand; in modern times these barriers might be covered or completely composed of concrete. The drained land is extremely fertile and makes excellent pasturage or cropland.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The first polders of reclaimed land were constructed in the 11th century AD, although building embankments as barriers to water date back to the Romans. The Dutch have a long history of reclaiming marshes and fenland, and even the seabed, and possess half of the polder acreage in Europe. Although there are polders in other countries of Europe, and examples can be found in Asia and North America, Holland has some 3000 polders accounting for about 27 percent of the country's land.

A feitoria served simultaneously as marketplace, warehouse, settlement, and staging point for exploration. Often established with a grant from the Portuguese crown, these private enterprises repaid their debt through the buying and selling of goods on behalf of the crown and through collecting taxes on trade that passed through their gates. During the 15th and 16th centuries, a chain of over 50 feitoria were built along the coasts of west and east Africa, India, Malaya, China, and Japan.

			<Text>A Kasbah is a type of medina (a walled quarter in a city) found in the countryside, usually a small settlement on a hilltop or hillside. Originally the home for a tribal chieftain or important Islamic imam, the Kasbah is characterized by high-walled, windowless houses and narrow, winding streets. It is usually dominated by a single fortified tower. Kasbahs were common along the North African coast and Middle East until the 1900s. Building a Kasbah was a mark of wealth, influence and power for Moroccan and Algerian families of Arab descent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A Kasbah can only be build on a desert tile.

			<Text>Perhaps better known as the "Easter Island Statues," the Moai are large, humanoid figures carved mostly from rocks like tuff. 887 of these statues dot Easter Island, and are believed to have been created sometime between 1250 and 1500 AD. Almost half still remain at the original quarry site, but the rest were transported and erected around the island's coastline. Easily recognizable by their large heads and elongated features, it is believed that they were individual depictions of deceased ancestors and powerful chiefs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While most scholars agree on why and how the statues were created, the method of their transportation still remains a mystery. Weighing from 9 to 87 tons a piece, they would have required an amazing feat of engineering to move from quarry to final resting place.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1994, the Moai statues were given official protection on the UNESCO World Heritage site list.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Must be built on coastal land.
