<!--Poor Tiles Tweak BlouBlou-->
<!--
Desert now Yield 1 Food instead of 'No Yield' (Only applied if the tile have no Base Yield, See Notes section)
Trading post can be built on Snow (but not farms)
Goody huts and barbarians camp can now spawn on Snow tile

Farm can be built on Tundra Tiles (Remember, no changes were made to tundra base yield, only the farm improvement unlock.)
The 'Fresh Water' concept has been extended and applied to Snow Tiles.

Civilopedia is fully updated regarding thoses changes. (see screenshots)

Having a Hill on a Snow tile will correctly remove the +1 Food and give the +2 Prod.
Having a Hill on a Desert tile will correctly remove the +1 Food (+2 prod is already enabled in vanilla).
The food increase to Desert wont be applied if the Tile is an Oasis or a Floodplain.

			<Set Text="Rivers are sources of fresh water, allowing the construction of farms on adjacent hills, tundra and snow tiles. Farms next to fresh water receive an additional +1 food when the Civil Service technology is researched. Units expend all of their movement points when crossing rivers. This is true even if the tiles are connected by roads, until the civilization learns the Engineering technology. Finally, units receive a -20% penalty when they are attacking across a river." />
